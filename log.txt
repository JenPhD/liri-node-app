Can't wait to see our new QB #Francois in action! And, I'm even more excited about #DalvinCook. Can you say #Heisman? #NoleforLife
Also, #CampingWorldStadium? No. It is, has been, will always be #TheCitrusBowl.
Looking forward to college football this weekend! Go Noles! Wish tix at #CampingWorldStadium weren't so dang expensive. WTH?
How many tweets is that?
Watch out #OleMiss. Them #FSU #Seminoles have gone 8-0-2 when they have played in Orlando dating back to 1952.
Seriously, highway 98 along #Carrabelle toward #Appalachicola washes out with every tropical system, it seems.
If you haven't drive highway 98 along the big bend of Florida, I highly recommend it...but not during a hurricane.
Please be safe, all my peoples in #Tallahassee and #FloridaStateUniversity #FSU #Seminoles
Hey, there's a hurricane.
